# Node Microservices API

This project is a Node.js-based microservices platform that handles dynamic deployment of apps in zip file format. The platform supports both HTTP and HTTPS modes and allows seamless app updates and management through file uploads.

## Features
- **Dynamic app deployment**: Automatically deploys apps by extracting them from uploaded zip files.
- **App management**: Supports loading and removing apps based on file events in the upload directory.
- **SSL support**: Runs in both HTTP and HTTPS modes (with SSL certificates).
- **Middleware integration**: Built-in security middleware to protect your app.
- **Logging**: Integrates an app-specific logger for detailed logs.
- **Database manager**: Provides database connectivity and management capabilities for each microservice.

## Project Setup

### Requirements
- **Node.js**: v14 or above
- **npm**: v6 or above
- **SSL Certificates**: Required for HTTPS mode (privkey.pem and fullchain.pem)

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration
You need to set up your environment variables. The `.env` file should be placed at the root of the project and contain the following variables:

```dotenv
PORT=3000 # HTTP port
PORT_HTTPS=3443 # HTTPS port
CERT_PATH=certs # Path to SSL certificates (only required for HTTPS)
```

### Directory Structure
- `uploads`: Directory for uploading zip files containing apps to be deployed.
- `apps`: Directory for storing deployed apps.
- `certs`: Directory containing SSL certificates for HTTPS.

## Running the Application

### HTTP and HTTPS Support
The application can run in either HTTP or HTTPS mode based on the presence of SSL certificates.

#### HTTPS Mode
For HTTPS mode, ensure you have the SSL certificates (`privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem`) in the `certs` directory.

Start the application in HTTPS mode using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app with HTTPS support and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

#### HTTP Mode
If SSL certificates are not available, the application will run only in HTTP mode. You can still deploy apps via the upload directory, but traffic will not be encrypted.

Start the application in HTTP mode:

```bash
npm start
```

### File Uploads
- **Upload your zip file containing an app** to the `uploads` directory.
- The application will automatically detect the new zip file and start deploying the app.
- If a file is removed from the `uploads` directory, the corresponding app is also removed.

### Loading Deployed Apps
- The platform automatically loads any previously deployed apps stored in the `apps` directory when the server starts.

## How It Works

1. **Watching Uploads Directory**: The application continuously watches the `uploads` directory for new zip files.
2. **Extracting and Deploying**: When a zip file is added, the platform extracts it and loads the app.
3. **App Management**: The app is deployed in a versioned structure in the `apps` directory.
4. **App Configuration**: Each app has its own database connection and logger. These are handled dynamically during the deployment process.
5. **SSL Configuration**: If SSL certificates are provided, the app will run in HTTPS mode. Otherwise, it runs in HTTP mode.

## Middleware and Security

- **App Guard**: A middleware to ensure secure access to the deployed apps.
- **Logger**: Each app has a separate logger for better error tracking and debugging.

## Database Manager

The **Database Manager** (`DBManager`) is a core component of the Node Microservices API. It handles database connectivity and management for each deployed microservice, ensuring that each microservice has access to its own isolated database.

### How It Works
Each microservice deployed via the Node Microservices API can be assigned its own database, and the Database Manager ensures that each app can interact with its dedicated database. The manager currently uses **SQLite** as the database solution for each microservice.

#### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Database Creation**: Automatically creates a new SQLite database file for each microservice.
- **App-Specific Databases**: Each microservice is assigned its own database stored in the app's directory.
- **SQLite Database**: The `DBManager` uses the SQLite database driver to open or create a new database for each app, ensuring the data is isolated per microservice.
- **Database Access**: Provides a simple API to access the database for each app via the `connectAppDB` method.

#### How to Use
1. **Configure Database Connection**: Each microservice's database is configured dynamically based on the app's deployment path.
2. **Database Connection**: The `connectAppDB` method is used to establish a connection to the microservice's SQLite database, or create it if it does not exist.

#### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s how you would use the `DBManager` in your microservice:

```javascript
import dbManager from "./engine/databases/index.mjs";

// Define app-specific information
const appInfo = {
  id: "myApp",
  version: "1.0.0",
  path: "/path/to/your/app/directory"
};

// Connect to the app's database
const appDb = await dbManager.connectAppDB(appInfo);

// Example query to interact with the database
const result = await appDb.all("SELECT * FROM users");
console.log(result);
```

#### `DBManager` Class
The `DBManager` class is implemented as a singleton. You can access its instance using the `getInstance` method.

```javascript
class DBManager {
    static getInstance(){
        const r = new DBManager();
        return r;
    }
    
    async connectAppDB(appInfo){
        fs.mkdirSync(appInfo.path, { recursive: true });
        const db = await open({
            filename: `${appInfo.path}/appdb.sqlite`,
            driver: sqlite3.Database
        });
        return db;
    }
}

const dbManager = DBManager.getInstance();
export default dbManager;
```

### Supported Database
The current implementation of the `DBManager` uses **SQLite** as the database solution. The database is created inside the app's specific directory, and each app has its own isolated database file (`appdb.sqlite`).

### Error Handling
- If an error occurs during the database connection or creation, the platform logs the error without taking down the entire server.
- Database-related issues are logged for further investigation.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing SSL certificates**: If SSL certificates are not found, the app will fall back to HTTP mode.
- **App deployment issues**: Check the `logs` for specific errors related to app extraction or loading.
- **Database connection issues**: Ensure the app's database directory and permissions are correctly set up. If the database file cannot be created, check the file path and ensure there is no permission issue.
